**Avrudu Litha 2024** (also known as **LithaProject**) was a groundbreaking digital platform that reinvented Sri Lanka‚Äôs cherished Sinhala-Tamil New Year (Avurudu) festivities for the digital age. Launched on **April 11, 2024**, and active until its acquisition on **May 2, 2024**, Litha2024 quickly became a cultural phenomenon, attracting over **200,000 users** nationwide and setting a record for native social media engagement on **April 14, 2024**.

Developed and hosted by **Neksha DeSilva** and the **NextackFDN** tech team, Litha2024 demonstrated the power of scalable, culturally relevant digital solutions. Its immense success led to its acquisition by a private Sri Lankan company for further development. The core model, originally created by Neksha, continues to thrive under a new brand, extending a legacy of innovation and cultural significance.
